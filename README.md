# Swamp Monster

This was a last-minute entry for the 2012 7-day roguelike challenge.

What it is: a simple roguelike game.

Goal: Survive a hundred turns in the swamp, or escape.

Controls: numlock+keypad, or vi keys. (By accident, this game is a great way
to train muscle memory for vi navigation.)

Should work in python2 and python3 on unix-like systems. I used to maintain a
Windows version also. It did not work well on Windows, and so I have withdrawn
the code that supported that.


# Background

During the 7drl festival, I had planned to make an ambitious game that
involved gardening. Late in the week, I realised I had no chance of
completing, and so adapted the engine towards this simple game.

There was an entertaining youtube review back in 2012.

The author stumbles on some features from the gardening game that I had failed
to remove when I was adapting it. I have since removed those features from the
game. During one part of the video, the reviewer could have escaped the swamp
but did not know to.
